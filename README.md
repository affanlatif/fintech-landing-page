# Fintech Application – Frontend Prototype

## Overview
This repository contains the frontend prototype of a fintech application developed as part of a hackathon submission. The project demonstrates the user interface, user flow, and core product vision through a functional web-based frontend.

The focus of this repository is rapid prototyping, clarity of design, and effective communication of the proposed solution.

## Solution Summary
- Interactive frontend showcasing the core user journey
- Modular and readable structure for easy extension
- Designed to integrate with backend services or APIs in future iterations

This prototype serves as a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) from a user-experience and presentation standpoint.
